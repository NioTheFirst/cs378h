# Compile instructions

1. Download the file. The default name is `lab1_brian_final.c`

2. Compile the file with -O2. Example: `gcc -O2 lab1_brian_final.c -o lab1_brian_final`

3. Run the file. Running `./{out}` will give you instructions. In the 100-line comments, there are the exact configurations I used to run on the UT onyx machine.
